# Unwinnable Tic Tac Toe

Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer - but you'll never win!

- The user has the advantage of the first turn and is always "X".
- The computer will always take the best path to win as quickly as it can.
- The buttons are disabled during the computer's turn so the user can't play multiple moves in one turn
